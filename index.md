Welcome to my page!

---

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in <a href="https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/t/margot-taylor/">Dr. Margot Taylor's</a> lab at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. My research here includes the ongoing collection and analysis of OPM-MEG data from toddlers and children with and without neurodevelopmental conditions. My research background has focused on the technical development and application of OPM-MEG for pediatric populations.
My postdoctoral research has been supported by a SickKids RESTRACOMP fellowship and I am currently funded by a Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) Fellowship Award.
